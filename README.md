# Digital Systems Design Labs

The following repository holds the source code written for laboratory experiments in the Digital System Design Labs which demonstrates examples of hardware design and testing. Source code conists of languages that include VHDL, C, and Python. Below is a brief description of each lab.

## Lab 1 - Bit Counter

Lab 1 demonstrates an 8-bit counter that can count up, count down, and reset its value.

## Lab 2 - MAC unit

Lab 2 demonstrates a MAC unit which takes streaming values from two sources, multiplies them together, and outputs a cumulative sum of all the products.

## Lab 3 - FIR Filter

Lab 3 demonstrates an implementation of a 25-tap bandpass FIR filter to restore a sine wave corrupted by a white noise.

## Lab 4 - FIR Filter

Lab 4 demonstrates an implementation of an FIR Filter in broadcasting form.
